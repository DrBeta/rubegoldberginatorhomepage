			<p>You send a message that a discord bot picks up, turns to a text file, and uploads via ftp to our server. That server then runs a script that creates a QR code and uploads it to imgbb. The script takes that image url and puts it in a [jsonbin](https://jsonbin.io/). My raspberry pi periodically checks the json bin and fetches the json to look for a new QR code with a python script. The python script runs a c++ script which decodes the QR code and returns the result. With that result, the script calls a Webhook that goes into a special channel in our discord server (linked in the links, go there to test it out).</p
